"The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day . . ."

A bit about myself:
I want to master the art of writing about myself; To do: list memorable snipetts of self description from admirable people: Steve Jobs, Roger Scruton, Marvin Minsky, Shivagam, Srila Prabhupada, Yoshio Sakamoto.
